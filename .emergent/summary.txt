The previous AI engineer successfully developed WhatsFlow, a WhatsApp automation system, from inception to a feature-rich application. Key challenges included adapting Baileys for a containerized environment, leading to an initial demo-mode implementation. Development was iterative, starting with core backend APIs and a basic frontend dashboard. This evolved into a sophisticated drag-and-drop funnel editor using React Flow, followed by a real-time messaging center with multi-device support and refined macro/webhook functionalities. Extensive installation scripts for local and public deployments were also provided. The current work involves implementing a dedicated Instâncias tab for managing multiple WhatsApp connections. The process was interrupted by a user report that the frontend preview did not update, and the AI engineer was debugging this issue by checking service statuses.

The user requested WhatsFlow, a WhatsApp automation system, for managing customer interactions and marketing funnels. The application needed:
1.  **WhatsApp Integration**: Via Baileys, with a demo mode initially due to environment constraints, and a future goal of real-time QR code connection for multiple, named WhatsApp instances.
2.  **Drag-and-Drop Funnel Builder**: A visual editor using React Flow, including components for text messages, conditional responses, tag management, media (audio, images, videos), with added features for message delays and visual connection ordering.
3.  **Real-time Messaging Dashboard**: A professional interface displaying active conversations, historical messages, and daily contact statistics.
4.  **Macro/Webhook System**: The ability to create macros that trigger webhooks, sending lead data (phone, JID, name). This evolved from a simple button to a dedicated right-side panel with multiple configurable buttons that appear only when a contact is selected.
5.  **Multi-Device Support**: Centralized management of messages from multiple WhatsApp numbers, visually tagged (e.g., WhatsApp 1).
6.  **Installation**: A simplified, one-command automatic installer for both public servers (with Nginx, SSL) and local environments.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **WhatsApp Integration**: Baileys (Node.js service).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, React Flow (for drag-and-drop editor).
-   **Environment Management**: Kubernetes (container environment), Supervisor (process control), Yarn, Pip.
-   **Data Handling**: Pydantic models, UUIDs, ISO strings for DateTime.
-   **Deployment**: Nginx, Certbot, PM2.

**Summary of Important Files and Changes:**
*   : Repeatedly modified to add API endpoints for WhatsApp service communication, contact, message, webhook management, and multi-device support, including  and filtered .
*   : Created and updated to manage the Baileys client lifecycle, QR code generation (including demo mode), message reception/sending, and status updates, relaying information to the FastAPI backend.
*   : Central to the frontend, updated to handle navigation, routing, and integration of new features like the , , and the currently developed  tab.
*   : Continuously updated to style new components, refine the layout (e.g., compact contact cards), and ensure a professional UI.
*   : Implemented the drag-and-drop UI for flow creation, incorporating various node types (Message, Condition, Delay) and connection capabilities using React Flow.
*   : Developed for the real-time chat dashboard, managing contact lists, message display, input, and integration with the macro sidebar.
*   : Added to provide the right-hand sidebar for displaying and triggering custom macros for a selected contact, improving the user experience for webhook interaction.
*   : A new component currently being implemented to manage multiple WhatsApp device connections, including the UI for creating new instances and generating QR codes.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of implementing a Sistema de Múltiplas Instâncias WhatsApp (Multiple WhatsApp Instances System). This involves creating a dedicated frontend tab named Instâncias where users can create new WhatsApp profiles, assign custom names, and generate unique QR codes for each instance to link their WhatsApp accounts.

Specifically, the AI engineer had just completed creating the initial structure for the  component and updated  to integrate this new tab into the main application navigation.

However, immediately after these modifications, the user reported a critical issue: Como ficou o site depois dessas modificações? O preview não atualizou (How did the site look after these modifications? The preview did not update).

The current work left off with the AI engineer beginning to debug this preview update issue by checking the status of the running services via backend                          RUNNING   pid 26, uptime 0:00:06
